# Sure! Here's the equivalent PowerShell code for the given BASIC code:

#```powershell
while ($true) {
    # Write-Host "HELLO WORLD!"
}
#```

# In PowerShell, you can achieve an infinite loop by using a `while` loop with a condition that is always true (`$true`). The `Write-Host` cmdlet is used to print the "HELLO WORLD!" message to the console.
